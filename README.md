# Hellooo Pal!! ðŸ‘‹
# Welcome to my humble profile.
## About Me

I'm Parsa Aghaee, A **Front-End Developer**. I make applications using **React** and **Next.js**, and I have over 4 years of experience in doing so. I'm currently learning more about **Back-End Development** right now, and I have some amount of familiarity with it (Not specialized).
I like my code to be clean and scalable; I like my application to be more performant, so I really like to read docs about achieving my goals and also to work with seniors with more experience than me so they could help my improve my skills.
